Give Claude Code (and other AI assistants) direct control of your real Chrome browser

Stop wrestling with headless browsers, bot detection, and authentication flows. Blueprint MCP for Chrome bridges the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with your actual Chrome browser - keeping you logged into all your sites, preserving your extensions, and using your real browser fingerprint.

THE CRITICAL ADVANTAGE: Efficient browser automation that does not consume your AI's context. Instead of sending massive page snapshots with every action (which quickly exhausts context limits and often exceeds MCP response size limits), Blueprint MCP lets your AI interact directly - click, type, navigate - and only fetch page content when specifically needed. This enables complex, multi-step workflows that would be impossible with snapshot-based approaches.

Perfect for developers using Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible AI client who need to automate web tasks without the headaches of Playwright/Puppeteer/Selenium.

WHY BLUEPRINT MCP + CLAUDE CODE CHANGES EVERYTHING

The problem: Traditional browser automation requires sending full page snapshots after every action, consuming thousands of tokens per interaction and hitting response size limits. You also lose logged-in sessions, face bot detection, and spend time configuring browser profiles.

The solution: Blueprint MCP connects your AI assistant to your real Chrome browser through direct commands. Your AI controls the browser - click, type, navigate - without needing page snapshots unless explicitly requested. This preserves context for actual decision-making instead of wasting it on redundant page content.

What this enables:
• AI-powered web scraping that bypasses bot detection
• Automated form filling with your saved passwords
• Testing workflows using your logged-in accounts
• Content extraction from authenticated sites
• Browser automation that works with 2FA and CAPTCHAs

KEY FEATURES

Real Browser Automation:
• Uses your actual Chrome profile - Stays logged into Gmail, GitHub, AWS, etc.
• Stealth mode - No bot detection. Uses your real browser fingerprint
• Extension support - Works alongside your existing Chrome extensions
• Session persistence - No re-authentication needed

Native MCP Integration:
• 20+ browser tools exposed via Model Context Protocol
• Tab management - Create, switch, close tabs programmatically
• DOM inspection - Get accessible page content
• Network monitoring - Capture requests, replay with authentication
• JavaScript execution - Run code in page context

Developer Experience:
• Zero setup - Install extension, works instantly
• Auto-reconnection - Survives browser restarts
• Debug mode - Verbose logging for troubleshooting
• Status visibility - Real-time connection status

Two Connection Modes:
• Free (Local) - WebSocket on localhost:5555, no cloud dependencies
• PRO (Cloud Relay) - Control browser from anywhere, multiple AI clients

Comprehensive Automation:
• Screenshots (full page or elements)
• Content extraction as Markdown
• Form automation (fill, dropdowns, file uploads)
• Mouse/keyboard control (click, type, hover, drag-drop)
• Performance metrics (Web Vitals)

Advanced Capabilities:
• Tech stack detection (40+ frameworks)
• Network request replay
• PDF export
• Dialog handling (alert/confirm/prompt)
• Extension management

HOW IT WORKS

Architecture:
AI Assistant (Claude Code) -> MCP Protocol -> MCP Server -> JSON-RPC over WebSocket -> Chrome Extension (this) -> Chrome APIs -> Your Chrome Browser

Setup (3 steps, 2 minutes):
1. Install MCP server: npm install -g @railsblueprint/blueprint-mcp
2. Install this Chrome extension
3. Configure AI client: claude mcp add browser npx @railsblueprint/blueprint-mcp@latest

The extension auto-connects when your AI client starts the MCP server.

USE CASES

1. Authenticated Web Scraping
Before: Manually log in, navigate, copy-paste data. Bot detection, session timeouts.
With Blueprint MCP: "Go to dashboard.company.com and extract the Q4 metrics table" - Uses your logged-in session automatically.

2. Multi-Step Form Automation
Before: 2 hours/week manually filling vendor forms across 5 portals.
With Blueprint MCP: "Fill out the vendor forms with my company info" - 2 hours -> 5 minutes.

3. Testing Logged-In Workflows
Before: Create test accounts, configure webhooks, manual testing.
With Blueprint MCP: "Test the upgrade flow from free to pro" - Tests with real authentication.

4. Documentation Screenshots
Before: 3+ hours manually capturing and editing screenshots.
With Blueprint MCP: "Generate screenshots for all onboarding steps" - Consistent screenshots in minutes.

5. API Testing via Browser
Before: Copy cookies manually, troubleshoot auth, replay requests.
With Blueprint MCP: "Capture API calls when I click Submit and replay them" - Debug with actual browser authentication.
